# Prompt Evaluation and Improvement

## Example: Order Tracking

**Initial Prompt:**  
"Where is my order?"

**Response:**  
"I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you clarify?"

---

**Improved Prompt:**  
"You are a customer support assistant. Help users track their orders by asking for the order number and offering helpful information."

**Improved Response:**  
"Sure! Please share your order number so I can help track your shipment."

## Reflections

- Specificity improves output
- Few-shot examples lead to more predictable tone
- Avoid ambiguous or too-short prompts
